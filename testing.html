            "Hi Amisha, thanks for having me. I'm Ahsan Ali, a Full-Stack Developer with over 3 years of experience in building scalable web applications, primarily using the MERN stack and Angular for front-end. I recently led the development of Dentistry99 at Haraz Co., a secure platform for dental vendors that integrated Stripe payments and real-time features â€“ very similar to the scalable systems your job description mentions. I'm excited about this role because I thrive in fast-paced teams, and your focus on high-quality, reliable code with Node.js, MongoDB, and Angular aligns perfectly with my expertise in creating user-centric solutions. I'd love to contribute to your mission by owning features from prototype to deployment.",

          question:
            "Great, that sounds promising. Our tech stack is Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB on the backend, Angular on the front-end, and AWS/Mongo Atlas for hosting. What technologies are you most comfortable with, and how do they match what we're using?",
          answer:
            "I have strong experience with Node.js and Express.js for building RESTful APIs, as well as MongoDB for flexible, scalable data storage â€“ I've used MongoDB Atlas in production for projects like Dentistry99, where I handled real-time data with WebSockets and Redis caching. For front-end, I've worked extensively with Angular for modular UI development, including components, RxJS for async handling, and lazy loading for performance. I also integrate third-party services like Stripe and Google Maps seamlessly. While my recent work at Haraz Co. involved Next.js and NestJS, I'm quick to adapt to pure Angular setups like yours, and I've deployed on AWS EC2 and Heroku, ensuring high availability.",

          answer:
            "Absolutely. I hold a BSc in Computer Science from Superior University Lahore (2022), which gave me a solid foundation. From Oct 2022 to Dec 2024, I was a MERN Stack Developer at Asian Solutions Pvt. Ltd., where I developed and maintained scalable apps, integrated APIs, and mentored juniors â€“ we delivered features under tight deadlines while ensuring clean, bug-free code. Since Jan 2025, I've been a Full-Stack Developer at Haraz Co., leading projects like Dentistry99, a vendor platform with Stripe payments, MFA security, and real-time chat via WebSockets. Other highlights include a real estate app with Google Maps integration for search filters and an e-commerce site with Redux state management and JWT auth. Across these, I've owned end-to-end features, from API design to Angular UIs, aligning with your need for owning prototypes to polished implementations in a fast-paced environment.",

          category: "nodejs",
          question:
            "What is Node.js and what is its key architectural feature?",
          answer:
            "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. Its key architectural feature is its **non-blocking, event-driven I/O model**. This means it uses a single-threaded event loop to handle concurrent requests efficiently, delegating I/O operations to the system kernel (which are multi-threaded) and using callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle the results. This makes it lightweight, efficient, and perfect for data-intensive real-time applications (RTAs) that run across distributed devices.",
        },
        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question:
            "Explain the Node.js Event Loop and how it enables non-blocking I/O.",
          answer:
            "The Event Loop is the core mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking operations despite being single-threaded. It continuously checks the call stack and a series of queues (Callback Queue, Microtask Queue for Promises). When an asynchronous operation (like a file read or network request) is initiated, it's offloaded to the system kernel. Once completed, its callback function is placed in a queue. The Event Loop, once the call stack is empty, picks callbacks from these queues and pushes them onto the stack for execution. This process enables handling thousands of concurrent connections without creating multiple threads.",
        },
        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question: "What is the difference between `require` and `import`?",
          answer:
            '`require` is the legacy, CommonJS syntax used to import modules in Node.js. It is synchronous and can be called anywhere in the code. `import` is the newer, ES6 (ECMAScript) module syntax. It is asynchronous and can only be used at the top of a file (statically analyzable). While Node.js now supports ES modules (using `.mjs` extension or `"type": "module"` in `package.json`), the ecosystem still heavily uses CommonJS. Key differences include how they handle default exports and their loading behavior.',
        },
        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question: "What is the purpose of the `package.json` file?",
          answer:
            "The `package.json` file is the manifest file for a Node.js project. It holds metadata relevant to the project and is crucial for managing dependencies. Its key purposes include: listing all project dependencies (`dependencies` and `devDependencies`), defining project scripts (`scripts` like `start`, `test`), specifying the project name, version, and entry point (`main`), configuring the Node.js package manager (npm) itself, and enabling reproducible builds by locking dependency versions (when used with `package-lock.json`).",
        },
        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question:
            "How does Node.js handle child processes and why are they needed?",
          answer:
            "Node.js provides the `child_process` module to create and manage subprocesses. This is needed to perform CPU-intensive tasks that would otherwise block the single-threaded event loop. Key methods include `spawn()` for launching a new process with a command, `exec()` for running a command in a shell and buffering the output, and `fork()` for spawning a new Node.js process specifically for running modules, enabling inter-process communication (IPC). This allows Node.js to leverage multi-core systems despite its single-threaded nature.",

        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question:
            "What is the Cluster module and how does it improve performance?",
          answer:
            "The `cluster` module allows you to create multiple instances of your Node.js application (worker processes) that share the same server port. It is used to leverage multiple CPU cores on a single machine. A master process forks worker processes and distributes incoming connections among them using a round-robin algorithm (by default). This significantly improves performance and throughput for applications that are not I/O bound but are instead constrained by the single-threaded CPU limit, as it effectively parallelizes the workload.",
        },
        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question:
            "Explain the concepts of `middleware` in the context of Express.js.",
          answer:
            "In Express.js, middleware are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle (`next`). They can execute any code, make changes to the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle (e.g., by sending a response), or call the next middleware. They are used for tasks like parsing request bodies (`express.json()`), authentication, logging, compression, and error handling, allowing for modular and organized application logic.",
        },
        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question:
            "How do you manage environment variables and configuration in Node.js?",
          answer:
            "The standard way is to use the `dotenv` package. You create a `.env` file in your project root (and add it to `.gitignore`) to store environment-specific variables like database URLs, API keys, and ports. The `dotenv.config()` function loads these variables into `process.env`. For more complex scenarios, you can use config management libraries like `config` or `nconf` that support hierarchical configurations for different environments (development, production, testing). This keeps sensitive credentials out of your codebase.",
        },
        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question: "What are Streams in Node.js and what are their benefits?",
          answer:
            "Streams are collections of data that might not be available all at once. Instead, data is read or written in chunks. There are four types: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform. The key benefit is **efficient memory usage** â€“ you can process large files (like videos) without loading the entire file into memory at once. This is crucial for performance and scalability. They also enable **pipelining** (using the `.pipe()` method), where data from a readable stream is directly passed to a writable stream with minimal overhead.",
        },
        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question: "What is the purpose of the `Buffer` class in Node.js?",
          answer:
            "The `Buffer` class is a global object designed to handle binary data directly. It represents a fixed-size chunk of raw memory allocated outside the V8 heap. It is essential when working with TCP streams, file system operations, or any context where it's necessary to deal with raw binary data, such as when dealing with image or video processing, encryption, or network protocols. Before the introduction of `TypedArray`, `Buffer` was the primary way to handle binary data in Node.js.",
        },
        {
          category: "nodejs",
          question:
            "How do you handle errors in Node.js applications effectively?",
          answer:

          answer:
            "Directives are classes that add custom behavior to DOM elements. There are three types: Components are directives with a template. Structural Directives (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) alter the DOM's layout by adding, removing, or manipulating elements. Attribute Directives (e.g., `NgClass`, `NgStyle`) change the appearance or behavior of an existing element, component, or another directive by manipulating its attributes. Directives are a powerful way to extend HTML's functionality.",

          answer:
            "Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where a class receives its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. In Angular, the DI framework provides dependencies (like services) to a class (like a component) upon request. You define a provider (often at the root module level via `providedIn: 'root'`) which acts as a recipe for creating the service. Angular's injector then creates and injects instances of these services into components, promoting loose coupling, easier testing, and greater modularity.",

          answer:
            "Angular provides the `HttpClient` service, available from `@angular/common/http`, to perform HTTP requests. It returns responses as Observables (RxJS), enabling powerful async operations like transformation, error handling, and retry logic. Key methods include `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, and `delete()`. You typically subscribe to the Observable returned by these methods in your component to initiate the request and handle the response or error. For complex scenarios, you can use interceptors to globally handle auth tokens or logging.",

It is configured by defining an array of Routes, where each route maps a URL path to a corresponding component. This configuration is imported via `RouterModule.forRoot(routes)` in the main AppModule. Navigation is achieved using the `routerLink` directive in templates and the `Router` service in component classes.

Because they are pure functions (same input yields same output), Angular can optimize performance by caching the results and avoiding re-rendering if the inputs haven't changed. This makes them more efficient than using component class methods in templates, which are called on every change detection cycle.",

Use the `debounceTime` operator to wait for a pause in typing (e.g., 400ms) before emitting the latest value. Then use `distinctUntilChanged` to only emit if the new value is different.

If the data is re-fetched from a server, new object references are created, causing Angular to tear down and rebuild all DOM elements. A `trackBy` function returns a unique identifier for each item (e.g., an `id` field). This allows Angular to identify which items were added, removed, or moved, and only manipulate the specific DOM elements that changed, significantly improving rendering performance for large lists.",

In Dentistry99, this approach delivered a secure, scalable platform on schedule, with regular stakeholder feedback ensuring alignment.",

          question:
            "How do you ensure clean, maintainable code in your projects, and what practices do you follow to achieve this?",
          answer:
            "I ensure clean code by following SOLID principles and modular design. In Dentistry99, I organized backend code into Express.js middleware and services, and frontend code into Angular components and modules. I use TypeScript for type safety, reducing runtime errors. Tools like ESLint and Prettier enforce consistent formatting, while GitHub code reviews catch issues early. I write clear documentation and use meaningful variable names. For example, in the e-commerce project, I refactored legacy code into reusable services, improving readability and reducing technical debt. Regular unit tests with Jest and Karma ensure code reliability. This approach makes the codebase maintainable and scalable.",

          question:
            "Can you share your experience with third-party integrations, such as Stripe or Google Maps, and how you ensure they are seamless and secure?",
          answer:
            "I have extensive experience with third-party integrations. In Dentistry99, I integrated Stripe for payment processing, implementing vendor onboarding, subscriptions, and payouts using Stripeâ€™s SDK. I secured API keys in environment variables and used OAuth for secure authentication. For the real estate project, I integrated Google Maps for location-based search, caching API responses to reduce costs and improve performance. I also integrated NodeMailer for low-stock alerts in Dentistry99, ensuring reliable email delivery. To ensure seamlessness, I test integrations with Postman and mock APIs, and for security, I validate all external data and use HTTPS. These integrations enhanced functionality while maintaining reliability.",
